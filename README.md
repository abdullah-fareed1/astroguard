🚀 NeuroGuard 5.0 – Hackathon Prototype
🧠 Overview

NeuroGuard 5.0 (Transcendence Suite) is an AI-driven astronaut neurohealth monitoring system designed for long-duration space missions (e.g., Mars exploration).

This prototype demonstrates how real-time physiological and cognitive data can be processed by an AI engine and visualized in a mission-style dashboard for astronauts and mission control.

The system provides:

Fatigue & Stress Monitoring

Sleep & Recovery Tracking

Predictive Risk Scoring

AI-Driven Countermeasure Recommendations

✨ Core Features

📊 NeuroHealth Dashboard – live view of fatigue, stress, and sleep debt.

🤖 AI Recommendations – closed-loop suggestions like naps, circadian light shifts, or workload redistribution.

🔍 Explainability Layer – simple reasoning behind each recommendation (e.g., “Low REM sleep → cortisol ↑ → fatigue risk +12%”).

👩‍🚀 Multi-Crew Support (demo) – monitor multiple astronauts in one interface.

📡 Real-Time Data Feed – JSON endpoint exposed via ngrok / hosted API.
